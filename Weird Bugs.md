This documents some of the weirdest bugs I've seen and some tricks to fix it

## `Esc` key is equal to `Ctrl+[` 

Not really a bug, but something to note. In Linux it just so happens that the combination of the keys `Ctrl` and `[` gives the keycode for the `Esc` key, so just a tip for the future


## `Astro-lsp` doesn't work!

This one's actually pretty annoying, as at 2024-14-02, the astro-lsp on neovim dosen't work the only solution I found was to install a previous version 
```bash
:MasonInstall astro-language-server@1.0.8
```

Hope it's fixed soon

## Accessing WSL files with `\\wsl$`

As a windows user, you can access your WSL files in the files explorer by opening the path `\\wsl$`, from here, you should be able to navigate the machine securely, copy or paste files.

Useful for a state where one downloads a binary on the windows, but wants to use it on their WSL

```

This error just popped out of nowhere, but here's how I fixed it...
I deleted the remote folder for that branch

```
rm -rf .git/refs/remotes/origin/<name of branch>
```

then I pulled again, and now all's good ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

```
git pull
```
