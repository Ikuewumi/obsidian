## Thermoregulation

Thermoregulation refers to the process involved in maintaining a relatively constant core body temperature

> CBT - Core Body Temperature

- It is crucial for life.
- It is regulated via _negative feedback_
- Human temperature is around 37.4°C
- CBT is lowest during sleep
- CBT in menstruating women takes a dip before ovulation, then increases by up to **1°C**, due to **progesterone**
- Thyroid hormone also increases CBT
- Alcohol can increase your set-point
- CBT is 0.7-1.0°C higher than oral or axillary temperature

### Why?
We need a regulated CBT because the body's processes can only proceed under optimal temps. Too high can denature proteins and cause malfunction, and too low can cause problems as well

### Homeostatic Mechanism
1. Receptor: Temperature receptors in the skin and periphery of the body (thermoreceptors), Also in great veins, hypothalamus and some abdominal viscera
2. Control Center: The core body's temperature set-point is controlled by the hypothalamus
3. Effector: This is divided into two methods for two different situations:
	1. Increasing the body temperature (When it's lower than the set-point): Occurs via
		1. Shivering to produce heat
		2. Vasoconstriction of blood vessels near the periphery (in the skin) to prevent heat loss
	2. Decreasing temp. (When it's higher than set-point):
		1. Vasodilation of vessels in the skin to enhance heat-loss
		2. Sweating: The sweat evaporates from the skin cooling it down.

### Clinical Application
The temperature set-point of the body at the hypothalamus can be changed, sometimes causing fever. This can be done by a wide variety of factors including toxins
